                   fix: (bug fix)
                   docs: (documentation)

                2. First line should be no longer than 72 characters
                
                3. After the first line, leave one blank line and provide detailed explanation if needed:
                   - Why was this change necessary?
                   - How does it address the issue?
                   - Any breaking changes?

                You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a Git commit message based on the provided code changes. Your goal is to create a clear, concise, and informative commit message that follows best practices.
                
                Input:
                - Code diff:
                ```
                {diff}
                ```
                
                Instructions:
                1. Analyze the provided code diff and branch name.
                2. Generate a commit message following this format:
                   - First line: A short, imperative summary (50 characters or less)
                   - Blank line
                   - Detailed explanation (if necessary), wrapped at 72 characters
                3. The commit message should:
                   - Be clear and descriptive
                   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
                   - Explain what and why, not how
                   - Reference relevant issue numbers if applicable
                4. Avoid:
                   - Generic messages like "Bug fix" or "Update file.txt"
                   - Mentioning obvious details that can be seen in the diff
                
                Output:
                - Provide only the commit message, without any additional explanation or commentary.
                
                Output Structure:
                <type>[optional scope]: <description>
                [optional body]
                Example:
                   feat(api): add endpoint for user authentication
                Possible scopes (examples, infer from diff context):
                - api: app API-related code
                - ui: user interface changes
                - db: database-related changes
                - etc.
                Possible types:
                   - fix, use this if you think the code fixed something
                   - feat, use this if you think the code creates a new feature
                   - perf, use this if you think the code makes performance improvements
                   - docs, use this if you think the code does anything related to documentation
                   - refactor, use this if you think that the change is simple a refactor but the functionality is the same
                   - test, use this if this change is related to testing code (.spec, .test, etc)
                   - chore, use this for code related to maintenance tasks, build processes, or other non-user-facing changes. It typically includes tasks that don't directly impact the functionality but are necessary for the project's development and maintenance.
                   - ci, use this if this change is for CI related stuff
                   - revert, use this if im reverting something

                 Guidelines:
                
                 1. <type>: Commit type (required)
                    - Use standard types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore

                    - Briefly mention the specific component or module affected
                
                 3. <subject>: Short description (required)
                    - Summarize the main change in one sentence (max 50 characters)
                    - Use the imperative mood, e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds"

                    - No period at the end
                
                 4. <body>: Detailed description (required)
                    - Explain the motivation for the change
                    - Describe the key modifications (max 3 bullet points)
                    - Mention any important technical details
                    - Use the imperative mood
                
                 5. <footer>: (optional)
                    - Note any breaking changes
                    - Reference related issues or PRs
                
                 Example:
                
                 feat(user-auth): implement two-factor authentication

                 • Update user settings for 2FA options
                
                 Notes:
                 - Keep the entire message under 300 characters
                 - Focus on what and why, not how
                 - Summarize diff to highlight key changes; don't include raw diff output
